# Welcome to the News Explorer WebApp

This application was made using ReactJS for the Frontend and NodeJS for the Backend.
I created this Application as a Final Project for the Practicum100 Web development course.

######

The application includes a User system, where you can sign up and login and save your favorite articles.
You can also use the App to search for news for the entire web where logged out as well.

Please enjoy and feel free to contact me.
